In recent years, collecting relevant data at Wireless Battle Mesh has been a
challenge and in some cases a failure. A relevant part of the WBM community
agrees that the lack of a well tested firmware for the testbed has been a major
hindrance to successful testing and data collection.
Past attempts of creating a testbed based on WiBed have failed too, apparently
due to lack of maintenance.
While LibreMesh hasn't been designed with testbeds in mind, thanks to its high
modularity and flexibility over many years it has gained most of the needed
features for testbed firmware. As a plus it is actively maintained by a
conspicuous and heterogeneous developer community from different community
networks in the world that participate in WBM, all propitious factors for a
satisfactory GSoC development project.


#### Milestones

* Create a working testbed network with LibreMesh
* Complete the implementation of lime-proto-babeld
* Prepare compilation profiles for lime-sdk for each test
* Document how to use the created firmware images to run scientifically valuable tests
* Document how to extend testbed to collect new kinds of data
* Document how to add support for testing of new protocols
* Simulate a WBM test and publish the data
* Eventually create lime-proto modules for new protocols that need testing
* Eventually demonstrate progress at next WBM


##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* Get a general understanding of community networks
* Get a general understanding of Wireless Battle Mesh
* Briefly study LibreMesh networking architecture
* Clearly understand LibreMesh software architecture
* Discuss possible development with mentors
* Buy low price compatible devices to operate the test network
