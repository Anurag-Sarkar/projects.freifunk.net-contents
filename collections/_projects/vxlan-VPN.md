This project is about implementing a broker for VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) to get a Layer 2 high performance VPN as an alternative to l2tp and fastd in Gluon. Furthermore the VXLAN-VPN-client should be optimized and integrated into the offical OpenWRT Repository. VXLAN-VPN-client code draft: (https://git.ffnw.de/sk/vxlan-vpn-client/-/tree/master)

#### Milestones

* Get familiar with existing code and protocols and start coding
* Implement broker and client, including debudding/testing
* Integrate into OpenWrt documentaion and gluon integration.

##### Preparation 

* Get familiar with VXLAN
* Get familiar with gluon (https://gluon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
