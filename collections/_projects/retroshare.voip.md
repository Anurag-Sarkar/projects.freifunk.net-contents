Retroshare already offers the possibility to talk using Voice/Video over IP, but
only as a toy system. It currently needs a skilled developer to integrate a
proper cross-platform video codec that would be capable of frame-rate
auto-adjustment and be robust to network delays. This is a challenging project
that needs a good understanding of how existing VoIP works and interacts with
the network layer, as well as a technical understanding of how video compression
works in general.

#### Milestones

* find a suitable cross-plaform video codec
* handle auto-adjustment of bandwidth for video/sound with proper priority handling to avoid gaps
* implement proper GUI device selection and notifications

##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* get familiar with the Retroshare network and existing VOIP code
* discuss possible options with the developers
