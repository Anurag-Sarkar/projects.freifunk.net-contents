The idea is to expose diferent endpoints to interact with the RetroShare database, creating databases, tables, relations... 
Then, make sure that this databse will correctly work on a distributed network paradigm. 

On this way, we could use libretroshare just as a library where to build decentriled apps easier. Would be much easy to implement any
use to the app, exploiting the already existing distributed features of RS.
