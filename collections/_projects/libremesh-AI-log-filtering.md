System logs are the clinic history of the device. It tells what has been
happening with it and when, and helps a technician to know if something is wrong
and how to deal with it.
With the world wide adoption of LibreMesh, community netowors have spreaded and
expanded and many of them now reach undreds when not thousands of routers.
Processing thousands of logs by hand is an almost impossible job, yet it is
extremely valuable to debug complex networking problems.
This GSoC idea is ought to develop an Artificial Intelligence based software to
detect what logs are relevant.


#### Milestones

##### GSoC Community Bonding

* The student should explore automatic ways to tag important/critical logs.
* The student must have a LibreMesh repository fork.
* The student must learn how to contribute code via merge request mechanism.
* The student should relate comfortably with the LibreMesh developers.
* The student should individuate one or more real world comminity network and establish a fluid cooperation relationship with them.


##### GSOC Midterm

* A package should be ready to be tested on community networks.


##### GSOC Final

* Deployment of the package in all the nodes of the chosen community network.
