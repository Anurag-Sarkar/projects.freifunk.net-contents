question: "How do I write a good proposal?"
---

1. First check if there's an idea you like on this page.
2. Get in touch with the mentors mentioned in this idea to get into this topic and get answers for your questions.
3. Define - maybe together with the mentor - some measurable milestones, so you can design a rough time table.
4. Refine and break down your milestones (maybe into stories), also together with the mentor.
5. Try to estimate what stories you can work on within the GSoC period. Please keep in mind that a typical project expects a workload of 175 hours over a period of 10 weeks.
6. Use our application template to introduce yourself and describe your project. The resulting document you should upload to the Google Summer of Code program website.
